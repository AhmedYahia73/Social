(sometimes called a <span class="text-primary larg">social networking site</span>) is an online platform which people use
to build social networks or <span class="text-primary"> social relationships</span> with other people who share similar 
personal or career content, interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections.
 <br />

Social networking services vary in format and the number of features.<br />
<br />They can incorporate a range of new information
and communication tools, operating on<span class="text-primary"> desktops and on laptops</span>, on mobile devices such
 as <span class="text-primary">tablet computers and smartphones</span>.<br /> 
 This may feature digital photo/video/sharing and diary entries online (blogging).<br /> <span class="text-primary">Online
community services</span> are sometimes considered <span class="text-primary">social-network services</span>
by developers and users, though in a broader sense, a<span class="text-primary"> social-network </span>
service usually provides an individual-centered service whereas online community services are groups centered.<br /> Generally 
defined as "websites that facilitate the building of a network of contacts in order to exchange various types of content 
online,"<span class="text-primary"> social networking sites</span> provide a space for interaction to continue beyond 
in person interactions.<br />
These computer mediated interactions link members of various networks and may help to create, sustain and develop new social 
and professional relationships.<br />

Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, digital photos and videos, posts, and to inform others about online 
or real-world activities and events with people within their social network.<br /> While in-person social networking 
<br />
<span class="text-primary">
– such as gathering in a village market to talk about events 
</span>
<br />
<span class="text-primary">
– has existed since the earliest development of towns, the web enables people to connect with others who
live in different locations, ranging from across cities to the ends of earth (of course, one must have internet 
connection to do so).<br /></span>
 Depending on the social media platform, members may be able to contact any other member.<br /> 
 In other cases, members can contact anyone they have a connection to, and subsequently anyone that contact has a 
 connection to, and so on.<br /> 
 The success of social networking services can be seen in their dominance in society today, with Facebook having a 
 massive 2.13 billion active monthly users and an average of 1.4 billion daily active users in 2017.<br />
 LinkedIn, a career-oriented social-networking service, generally requires that a member personally know another member 
 in real life before they contact them online.<br /> Some services require members to have a preexisting connection to
contact other members.<br />
With COVID-19, Zoom, a videoconferencing platform, has taken an integral place to connect people located 
around the world and facilitate many online environments such as school, university, work and government meetings.<br />

The main types of social networking services contain category places (such as age or occupation or religion), means to 
connect with friends (usually with self-description pages), and a recommendation system linked to trust.<br />
One can categorize social-network services into four types:<br />
<span class="text-primary">
- socialization social network services used primarily for socializing with existing friends (e.g., Facebook, Instagram)
<br />
- online social networks are decentralized and distributed computer networks where users communicate with each other 
through internet services.<br />
- networking social network services used primarily for non-social interpersonal communication 
(e.g., LinkedIn, a career- and employment-oriented site)<br />
- social navigation social network services used primarily for helping users to find specific information or resources 
(e.g., Goodreads for books, Reddit)<br /></span>
There have been attempts to standardize these services to avoid the need to duplicate entries of friends and interests 
(see the FOAF standard).<br />
 A study reveals that India recorded world's largest growth in terms of social media users in 2013.<br />
A 2013 survey found that 73% of U.S. adults use social-networking sites.
